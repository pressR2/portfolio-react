# Portfolio (React)
The main goal of this project is to show most of the web technologies skills I've learned by now and to continue practice with React framework.
## About
This application shows my bio and projects I've made. The projects have a short embedded video that presents its look and capabilities. For each project, there is also a description, and a list of web technologies used to build them. The content and list of the projects are dynamically loaded, they can be changed by editing the `data.json` file. The site is fully responsive. Provides comfortable reading on both desktop and mobile devices. The app includes standard accessibility features and is accessible for screen reader use.
